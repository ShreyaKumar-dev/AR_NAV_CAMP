# AR_NAV_CAMP
Augmented Reality (AR) based Indoor Navigation Application
<br><br>
AR NAV CAMP project is motivated to build from the growing need for efficient indoor navigation solutions.
<br>
Traditional navigation apps are predominantly designed for outdoor use and are often ineffective within the confines of buildings. This limitation has led to frustration and time wastage for users trying to find specific locations indoors. Our project aims to address this issue and offer a more intuitive and user-friendly solution for indoor navigation.
