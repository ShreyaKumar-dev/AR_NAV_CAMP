# AR_NAV_CAMP
Augmented Reality (AR) based Indoor Navigation Application
<br><br>
AR NAV CAMP project is motivated to build from the growing need for efficient indoor navigation solutions.
<br>
Traditional navigation apps are predominantly designed for outdoor use and are often ineffective within the confines of buildings. This limitation has led to frustration and time wastage for users trying to find specific locations indoors. Our project aims to address this issue and offer a more intuitive and user-friendly solution for indoor navigation.
<br>
<h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
To tackle lack of accurate and user-friendly indoor navigation tools.
<br>
<h2>Objective:</h2>
1. Develop an AR-based indoor navigation system that can accurately guide users to their desired destinations within complex indoor environments.<br>
2. Create a user interface that is easy to understand and accessible.
3. Implement real-time positioning and mapping technology to provide up-to-date navigation instructions.
<br>
<h2>Architechture of the application:</h2>
<b>1. Hardware Components</b>
<br>
1.1 User device: To run application <br>
1.2 Sensors: Camera (captures userâ€™s movements, orientations, and visual data for precise indoor positioning and AR overlays.)
<br>
<b>2. Software Components</b>
<br>
2.1 Operating System: Android or IOS <br>
2.2 AR Development Framework: Unity, ARKit or ARCore (These frameworks enable marker tracking, object recognition, and 3D rendering.)
<br>
<b>3. Navigation Algorithm and Framework</b>
